# My4Server
My for Server

I've been working on this not too long! It is basic and can only answer a few questions, because of errors with Wikipedia!
If you deploy it on Heroku, any Wikipedia, PyOWM parsing could not be handled!

Instead you can deploy it on your Raspberry Pi locally and you can know that we aren't collecting any data on that way!

# Link to test
http://my-assistant-eu.herokuapp.com/api/v1?text=how%20are%20you

It returns a JSON!

# Usage
This could be used for example to get My on your phone or a computer.

Android app is already made with MIT AppInventor, and I hope a new Java release with code could come out soon: https://github.com/mytja/My4Android
